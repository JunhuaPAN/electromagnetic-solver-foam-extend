# electromagnetic-solver-foam-extend
This code efficiently solves high-frequency electromagnetic fields. 
It has been developed in foam-extend 4.0 and tested on a Linux Mint 19.1 system.

The solver is based on the vector potential formulation of Maxwell's equations, which is solved in the frequency domain.
